// SessionStart provisioning hook — the SINGLE cross-platform implementation (review-r5).
//
// This file used to be a dispatcher that picked provision.sh (POSIX) or provision.ps1 (Windows),
// which encoded the same launcher twice in two shell dialects — root fallback, uv PATH prepend,
// Python>=3.10 probe, bootstrap hand-off — with interpreter-candidate lists that had already
// drifted apart. Node is present wherever Claude Code runs, so the whole job now lives here on the
// shared resolver (_engine_resolve.mjs systemPython, which absorbed the versioned python3.x probe
// tail). provision.sh / provision.ps1 remain as one-line dev shims that exec this script.
//
// The launcher finds a Python >= 3.10 and hands off to scripts/bootstrap.py, which does the real,
// idempotent provisioning in a DETACHED background process and returns in milliseconds — so the
// bounded synchronous spawn below is cheap and the detached worker outlives this script.
//
// NB: no pointer-only fast path here. The interpreter pointer (engine-python.txt) survives a
// plugin update that changes dependencies, so short-circuiting on its existence would skip the
// background rebuild on exactly the update case it's meant to handle. Always hand off to
// `bootstrap.py --background`, which checks the content STAMP (the real freshness gate) and
// returns in milliseconds when current.
//
// Failure is silent by design (this is a background hook): if anything goes wrong — no suitable
// Python, no bootstrap script — the MCP launcher provisions in the foreground the first time the
// server is spawned, with a clear, actionable message.
