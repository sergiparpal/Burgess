Burgess fuses two engines around one boundary:

- a **convergence engine** (from [Sproutgraph](https://github.com/sergiparpal/Sproutgraph)) that grows source documents into a rigorously grounded, queryable knowledge graph — human-editable canon, three-axis provenance, a span-present write boundary, a grounding loop with permanent memory of failures, and a regenerable NetworkX/SQLite derived layer;
- a **divergence engine** (from [Cambrian](https://github.com/sergiparpal/Cambrian)) that turns any brief into a diverse, non-cliché slate of ideas — a local, server-less MAP-Elites archive with k-NN geometric novelty, DPP slate selection, and an anti-collapse monitor, with you steering and selecting in chat.

The name is the thesis: the **Burgess Shale** is where the Cambrian explosion's forms were preserved in stone — divergence and grounding in one word.

One sentence resolves every design dispute in this codebase: **embeddings measure dispersion, never truth.**

## Install

```text
/plugin marketplace add sergiparpal/Burgess
/plugin install burgess@sergiparpal
```

For local development, point Claude Code at a checkout instead:

```bash
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/Burgess
```

On first load a SessionStart hook provisions a local Python venv (Python ≥ 3.11 recommended; `uv` preferred, stdlib `venv`+`pip` fallback) in the plugin's persistent data dir. Everything runs locally; the divergence embedder is [model2vec](https://github.com/MinishLab/model2vec) `potion-multilingual-128M` (CPU, torch-free, ~120 MB, cached after first download).

## Quick start

Installed? This is the whole everyday flow — the commands you'll actually type, in the order you'd reach for them. Run each in Claude Code and steer the rest in plain chat; skip any phase you don't need.

`/kg-diverge` → `/kg-build` → `/kg-ground` → `/kg-generate` → `/kg-query` · `/kg-view`

1. **Brainstorm** *(optional)* — `/kg-diverge <brief>` opens a wide, non-cliché idea slate. **Pin** the keepers in chat, then ask Claude to *materialize* them into the graph as hypotheses. No document required — this half stands alone.
2. **Build** — `/kg-build <file / folder / glob>` turns your source into a span-anchored graph; everything starts **unverified**. It's additive — run it again with another document to grow the same graph.
3. **Verify** — `/kg-ground` is the **only** command that can mark anything trusted: it confirms each relationship against a verbatim span in your source. Whatever fails becomes permanent negative memory and is never re-proposed.
4. **Expand** *(optional)* — `/kg-generate` lets the graph's own structure propose fresh hypotheses (unlinked pairs, neglected concepts, …). Generation never filters — run `/kg-ground` again to judge the new candidates.
5. **Use** — `/kg-query <question>` answers from the grounded graph with trust levels and provenance attached; `/kg-view` renders an offline `graph.html` + `GRAPH_REPORT.md`.

If you just have a document and a question, that's a three-command first session:

```text
/kg-build notes/*.md      # build a graph from your source(s)
/kg-ground                # fact-check it against that source
/kg-query "<question>"    # ask it — answers carry their provenance
```

Prefer it in plain language, nothing assumed? The full walkthrough is [`TUTORIAL.md`](TUTORIAL.md); every command's exact arguments are in the [cheat sheet](#command-cheat-sheet) below.

## The fused pipeline

```text
/kg-diverge <brief>        pure divergence — no graph, no source document required
      │  cliché map → mechanism-first generation (the agent) →
      │  embed → MAP-Elites bins → k-NN novelty → DPP slate (the engine) →
      │  you pin / discard / answer A-vs-B in chat, monitor watching
      ▼
 pins materialize          explicit action, propose lane ONLY → provenance=hypothesized,
      │                    epistemic_state=unverified, lineage in the body; no source? they wait
      ▼
/kg-ground                 the ONLY verdict path: promotion needs support (a verbatim span or
      │                    citation); failures are PERMANENT negative memory. A FALSIFIED pin
      │                    flows back into the brief's discards; a merely-unsupported novel pin
      │                    waits in the lane, recoverable, until you add sources
      ▼
/kg-generate               seven structural mechanisms propose from the graph itself; with
                           divergence.dpp on, the same slate is presented in advisory-DPP order
                           with geometry labels (measured blind; see docs/fusion/EXPERIMENT.md)
```

Plus everything the convergence side always did: `/kg-build`, `/kg-query`, `/kg-eval`, `/kg-experiment` (now with a `graph+generate+dpp` arm), `/kg-perturb`, `/kg-view`.

## Command cheat sheet

Every slash command, with its arguments. The everyday flow is **diverge → build → ground → generate → query → view**; `/kg-perturb`, `/kg-eval`, and `/kg-experiment` are the optional "going further" commands. Arguments in `<angle brackets>` are **required**; those in `[square brackets]` are **optional** and fall back to a sensible default.

| Command | What it does | The detail in brackets |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/kg-diverge <brief> [domain-template] [reach]` | Diverge from a brief into a non-cliché slate; pin/discard in chat; optionally materialize the pins — no graph or source needed | **Required:** your creative brief. *Optional:* a domain template to steer the mechanisms; a `reach` dial — `conservative\|balanced\|wild` (default `balanced`) — capping how far out the slate goes in *degree*, never in *kind* |
| `/kg-build [source_path] [wave_size]` | Extract a span-anchored graph from your source (wave-parallel extractors); additive to any existing graph | *Optional:* the document / folder / glob to build from (defaults to your `source_path` config); how many sections per parallel wave |
| `/kg-ground [query-or-node-filter]` | Run the grounding loop — the **only** verdict path: promotions need support, failures become permanent memory | *Optional:* limit it to one topic or node area (defaults to the whole backlog) |
| `/kg-generate [mechanism-set] [k]` | Propose hypothesized candidates from graph structure (7 mechanisms; optional advisory-DPP order) | *Optional:* which mechanism(s) — `bridge\|seed\|compression\|regroup\|transplant\|ensemble\|periphery`; how many candidates |
| `/kg-perturb [second_source_or_graph_json]` | Build a second, independent construction and cross-generate to surface bridges your own view would resist | *Optional:* a second document or `graph.json` (defaults to a re-angle of the same source) |
| `/kg-query <question>` | Answer from the grounded graph, with provenance and falsification counters attached | **Required:** your question |
| `/kg-view [html\|report\|all]` | Render the offline `graph.html` + `GRAPH_REPORT.md`; read-only — it never changes the graph | *Optional:* which artifact to render (defaults to both) |
| `/kg-eval [graph.json]` | Measure extractor precision (Stage 4) and grounding reliability (Stage 7) | *Optional:* which `graph.json` to grade (defaults to the current derived graph) |
| `/kg-experiment [prompts_path]` | Blind multi-arm ideation experiment (control / graph / graph+generate / graph+generate+dpp / rag) | *Optional:* a file of test prompts (defaults to the built-in set) |

Remember: the status check (`kg_ping`) and the other behind-the-scenes MCP tools have **no** slash — just ask Claude for them in plain words.

## Architecture in six invariants

1. **Verdict monopoly** — only `kg_ground` produces verdicts; nothing in `kg_engine/divergence/` can set or upgrade an epistemic state (import-firewall-tested, adversarially attacked in the suite).
2. **Span-present boundary** — no span-less `grounded` edge can exist; forged verdicts are stripped at the boundary and re-quarantined by the reconciler.
3. **Advisory ceiling** — DPP order, novelty, cliché distance, bins, monitor readings influence *what is proposed and in what order*, never *what is true* (snapshot-tested: grounding output is bit-identical with the geometry flag on vs off).
4. **Different-family judge** — the diversity embedder (model2vec) never shares lineage with the generator (Claude), so the geometry can't just agree with the model that made the ideas.
5. **Session-ephemeral archives** — MAP-Elites archives never persist across sessions; only pins, discards, comparisons and session metadata do (project-local, git-friendly, under `.kg/diverge/`). The knowledge graph is the durable archive.
6. **Unified negative memory** — human discards and grounding failures live in one semantic store; neither generation path ever re-proposes from it.

The knowledge-graph spine: canon = one human-editable Markdown file per node (git-mergeable, semantic merge driver); derived = regenerable NetworkX/SQLite projections; MCP server (`burgess`, 27 tools) is the trust boundary; six subagents (extractor, grounder, adversarial-grounder, generator, annotator, evaluator) do the language work; the engine stays deterministic.

The full, self-contained architecture reference — module map, data model, write-boundary contract, tool surface, divergence internals and constants, runtime and environment — is [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## What this does not guarantee

In the spirit of both donors, honestly:

- **Grounding guarantees fidelity to your source, never truth about the world.** A grounded edge means a verbatim span supports it in *your* document — not that the document is right.
- **Novelty numbers are variety proxies.** `novelty` is k-NN distance to *this session's own ideas*; `originality` is distance to *the agent's own* guess at the clichés. Neither is novelty against prior art or the world.
- **The cliché map hedges cliché; it does not guarantee freshness.** "Obvious" is the model's notion of obvious.
- **The judge is bounded, not infallible.** Validity filtering is clipped to a [0.7, 1.3] multiplier at weight 0.3 — it can nudge, it cannot veto diversity; bad ideas can still reach you (that's the point: you are the selector).
- **The DPP presentation is advisory.** Whether it actually lifts downstream ideation was measured blind (see `docs/fusion/EXPERIMENT.md`); the shipped default follows that measurement, not our enthusiasm.

## Tests

<!-- test-count:begin -->
The suite currently reports: **1184 passed, 2 skipped** (`uv run --extra dev pytest tests/`).
<!-- test-count:end -->

This line is generated from pytest output, never hand-written. Run it yourself:

```bash
uv sync --extra dev   # or: pip install -e ".[dev]"
uv run pytest tests/
```

The fusion invariants live in `tests/fusion/` (import firewall, DB isolation, adversarial forge attempts, graceful degradation, archive ephemerality, snapshot invariance, verdict neutrality); the divergence engine's ported suite in `tests/fusion/divergence/`; the vendored convergence suite at `tests/`.

## Lineage

Burgess is a fusion of two MIT-licensed plugins by the same author, both of which continue as independent projects:

- **Sproutgraph** — <https://github.com/sergiparpal/Sproutgraph> — the convergence spine (engine, MCP boundary, commands, agents, experiment harness, canon/derived model), vendored at `17c4066`.
- **Cambrian** — <https://github.com/sergiparpal/Cambrian> — the divergence engine (embedder, MAP-Elites, novelty, DPP, monitor, judge bounds, cliché discipline), vendored at `a2adfa1`.
