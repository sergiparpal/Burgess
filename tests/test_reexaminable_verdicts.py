"""The R3-MIRROR "re-examinable verdicts" advisory (non-monotonic evidence).

A grounding verdict is permanent negative memory: once an item is `failed` (actively falsified) or
`rejected` (unsupported), the grounder never revisits it (its queue is `unverified`-only). R3 flags the
one-directional case (a grounded/failed SPAN-PRESENT edge whose span DISAPPEARED). This advisory mirrors
R3 for the opposite, equally real case: a `failed`/`rejected` item — NODES and SPAN-LESS items included,
which R3 cannot cover — was judged against a source set that has since CHANGED, so new evidence may make
it supportable. It is READ-ONLY: it never mutates a verdict and never re-queues anything; re-grounding
stays an explicit `kg_ground` decision. A term-overlap filter keeps only items the changed source bears on.
