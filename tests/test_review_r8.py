"""Regression pins for the 2026-07-05 exhaustive review round (review-r8).

Each test corresponds to one verified finding and FAILS against the pre-fix code (every fix is
mutation-catching). Findings keep the review's numbering; grep `review-r8-N` in the engine for the
per-fix rationale.

  1  server.kg_rename dropped a grounding verdict when the endpoint rewrite collapsed two edges onto
     one canonical id (no dedup, unlike kg_merge) — the {e.id: e} collapse kept the wrong one.
  2  A kg_propose re-proposal of an already-grounded edge deduped-and-accepted (CORRECT — grounded
     structure must not block generation; only FAILURE_STATES bind it) but the canon merge dropped its
     source_file / confidence / confidence_score / authored_by.
  3  node_content_hash hashed the raw body while the disk round-trip strips leading/trailing newlines,
     so a trailing-\\n body defeated canon's idempotent-no-op write guard (churn on every re-run).
  4  groundaudit.audited_write raised a spurious OrphanAuditError on an empty-records rollback when the
     audit log did not exist yet (nothing appended → no orphan can exist).
  5  The re-examinable-verdicts term filter read incremental-parse shells (no body/notes), so a
     body-only distinguishing term never re-surfaced a falsified item.
  6  _unseal_discards un-sealed ANY named cid — a genuine user discard, unknown id, or still-valid
     failure — instead of only the currently re-examinable set; a bare-string reexamine iterated chars.
  7  The backend scrubbed only the section body, egressing the raw heading (PII/secret) to the API.
  8  A leading UTF-8 BOM stopped the first `## heading` matching, folding the first section into the
     preamble.
  10 A cross-owner edge_id collision resolved by node iteration order, so full vs incremental
     projection disagreed on which edge survived.
  12 A renamed (identical-content) source file was mistaken for newly-added evidence.
  13 The overlap tokenizer was ASCII-only, so the whole advisory went silent on a non-Latin source.
  16 _payload_receipt omitted file_type, so a file_type-only change replayed as an idempotent no-op.
  17 harness.absorption crashed on a non-dict history instead of degrading.
  18 harness._score_condition mis-scored a bare-string condition value character-by-character.
