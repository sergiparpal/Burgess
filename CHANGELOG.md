# Changelog

## 0.2.2 — 2026-07-07

Patch release. Fixes a Windows/Py3.14 projection hang and adds nothing else — no
API or tool-surface changes (the 27-tool surface is unchanged).

### Fixed

- **`kg_context` (and any lazy-projecting read) could hang for HOURS on Windows/Py3.14
  instead of failing.** Two chained defects. (1) The projector imports the heavy native
  deps (`numpy` → OpenBLAS, `igraph`, `leidenalg`) **lazily**, deep inside
  `projector._leiden`, so on a populated canon the *first* read that projects triggered
  the very first `import numpy` **from inside an MCP handler** — i.e. on the event-loop
  thread while anyio worker threads were already alive. That late, cross-thread native
  load could deadlock the Windows loader lock and never return. (2) When the 300s handler
  watchdog then tripped, its `os._exit(71)` routed through `ExitProcess`, which needs that
  **same** loader lock to run DLL-detach teardown — so the force-exit deadlocked too, the
  process never died, the supervisor never relaunched, and 300s became ~4h of silent hang.
  Fixed at the root: the server now **pre-loads numpy/networkx/igraph/leidenalg once at
  startup on the main thread, before the watchdog and serve loop start**
  (`server._preload_native_deps`), so the projector's later lazy imports are pure
  `sys.modules` cache hits that take no loader lock — and the watchdog's force-exit is now
  a **teardown-free hard kill** (`server._hard_exit`: `TerminateProcess` on Windows,
  `SIGKILL` on POSIX) that can't be blocked by a wedged native import. Both stay
  best-effort/graceful (a missing native dep still degrades to the pure-Python
  label-propagation fallback). Pinned by the `#7b`/`#7c` cases in
  `tests/test_resilience.py`.

## 0.2.1 — 2026-07-06

Patch release. Fixes a `source_path` configuration bug and adds nothing else — no
API or tool-surface changes.

### Fixed

- **A quoted `source_path` silently resolved to nothing.** A source path the user
  wrapped in quotes reached the engine (`KG_SOURCE_PATH`) and the `/kg-build` bash
  (`CLAUDE_PLUGIN_OPTION_SOURCE_PATH`) with the literal surrounding quotes intact,
  so `Path('"C:\\dir\\file.md"')` pointed at a nonexistent quote-wrapped path and
  the engine degraded to an empty source with no error. (The doubled backslashes
  shown in the settings UI are only Claude Code's JSON rendering of the stored
  value — the substituted env value carries single backslashes; the quotes were
  the real breakage.) The canonical env-value cleaner (`envconfig._dequote`,
  applied in `clean()` — the single home the server, headless backend,
  `/kg-perturb`, and the PreToolUse hook all route through), its declared JS twin
  (`_engine_resolve.dequote`), and the `/kg-build` file-enumeration bash now peel
  matched surrounding quote pairs **repeatedly**, so even a double-wrapped
  `""path""` collapses to the bare path. Only symmetric pairs peel — an interior or
  mismatched quote stays part of the path. The `source_path` userConfig description
  now also asks for the bare path without quotes. Pinned by
  `tests/test_fix_source_path_quotes.py`.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-07-06

Feature + hardening release. Adds the **re-examinable-verdicts advisory** (a
read-only R3-mirror that flags `failed`/`rejected` items — nodes and span-less
items included — whose source set has since grown, so old negative memory may now
be supportable) with its divergence-side mirror and explicit un-seal lever. Also
lands the 2026-07-05 exhaustive review (review-r8, 23 findings), the
novel-`/kg-diverge`-pin grounding fix, and a test-import repair so the documented
`pytest tests/` command reproduces the reported suite count. No breaking API or
tool-surface changes; the 27-tool surface is unchanged (`kg_diverge_recall` gains
an optional `reexamine` parameter).

### Fixed

- **2026-07-05 exhaustive review (review-r8) — 23 findings across the engine, all
  landed with mutation-caught regression pins in `tests/test_review_r8.py`.**
  - **`kg_rename` silently dropped a grounding verdict** (high): an endpoint
    rewrite that collapsed two of a node's edges onto one canonical id persisted a
    duplicate id (no dedup, unlike `kg_merge`), and the downstream `{e.id: e}`
    collapse kept the wrong edge. It now coalesces collisions via `_merge_edge_pair`
    (negative-info-sticky, verdict-preserving) while keeping legitimate `new→new`
    self-loops.
  - **Re-proposing a grounded edge dropped its provenance metadata**: the
    hypothesized-lane dedup is correct (only `FAILURE_STATES` bind generation — a
    grounded edge is live structure, not a refutation), but `canon._merge_into_existing`
    preserved only state/span, blanking `source_file`/`confidence`/`confidence_score`/
    `authored_by`. It now carries all of the grounded edge's evidence.
  - **`node_content_hash` churn**: a body with a trailing `\n` (normal LLM output)
    hashed differently from its own disk round-trip, defeating canon's idempotent-
    no-op write guard so every re-run rewrote the note. The hash now folds the body
    the same way the disk round-trip does.
  - **`groundaudit` spurious `OrphanAuditError`**: an empty-records rollback against
    a not-yet-created audit log raised a false §1.8 durability breach (nothing was
    appended → no orphan). Compensation is now guarded on `records`.
  - **Re-examinable-verdicts term filter read body-less shells**: a source-only
    change projects via the incremental (shell) arm, so the filter saw no node
    body / edge notes and a body-only distinguishing term never re-surfaced a
    falsified item. It now re-reads the full note from canon for the small
    candidate set. The overlap tokenizer is also unicode-aware (was ASCII-only, so
    the whole advisory went silent on a non-Latin source), and a renamed
    identical-content source file is no longer mistaken for newly-added evidence.
  - **`kg_diverge_recall(reexamine=...)` un-sealed too much**: it revived ANY named
    cid — a genuine user discard, an unknown id, or a still-valid failure — and a
    bare-string argument iterated character-by-character. It now un-seals only the
    currently re-examinable set and reports only what was actually un-sealed;
    pre-feature `failed` ledger entries get a backfilled baseline so a later source
    change can surface them.
  - **Egress-scrub gaps**: the backend scrubbed only the section body, egressing the
    raw `## heading` (PII/secret) in the prompt; the optional `lightrag` arm shipped
    the raw source to OpenAI unscrubbed. Both now scrub before egress.
  - **Deterministic derived layer**: a cross-owner `edge_id` collision (hand-edited
    foreign-source edge duplicating a natural one) resolved by node iteration order,
    so full vs incremental projection disagreed; resolution is now deterministic
    (natural owner wins). A leading UTF-8 BOM no longer folds the first `##` section
    into the preamble, and a contended cold-start projection can no longer clobber a
    real `graph.json` with an empty placeholder (exclusive create).
  - **Smaller hardening**: `_payload_receipt` now includes `file_type` (a
    file_type-only change no longer replays as a no-op); `harness.absorption`
    tolerates a non-dict history and `_score_condition` no longer character-scores a
    bare-string condition value; `provision.mjs` no longer leaves an empty PATH
    element (CWD on the probe search path); `validate_plugin` anchors the
    `__version__` scan; `select_diverse(seed=)` is documented as a deterministic
    no-op; `kg_diverge_metrics` reports `mean_cosine_n` (the subsample size above the
    novelty cap); and the launcher's synchronous cold-start catch-up has a hard
    ceiling so a wedged install can't block session startup indefinitely.
- **The review-r8 backend-scrub pin made the suite red under the *documented*
  command.** `test_r8_7_backend_scrubs_section_title` used `from tests.test_backend
  import _FakeClient` — the only `from tests.` import in the whole suite. It resolves
  only when the repo root is on `sys.path`, which `python -m pytest` adds (cwd) but the
  console-script `uv run pytest tests/` that the README/CLAUDE.md document does **not**;
  pytest puts `tests/` on the path, not the repo root, so the run failed with
  `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tests'`. It now imports the sibling module
  top-level (`from test_backend import _FakeClient`), matching every other test, so the
  documented command reproduces the documented `1101 passed, 2 skipped`.

### Added

- **Re-examinable-verdicts advisory (R3-mirror) for non-monotonic evidence.**
  Grounding verdicts are permanent negative memory and the grounder never
  revisits them; the only source-change reaction (the R3 stale-verdict advisory)
  fired one direction — a `grounded`/`failed` span-present edge whose span
  *disappeared*. A new **read-only** mirror flags the opposite case: a
  `failed`/`rejected` item — **nodes and span-less items included, which R3
  cannot cover** — that was judged against a source set which has since **grown
  or changed**, so it may now be supportable and deserves a re-look. It **never
  mutates a verdict and never re-queues** (re-grounding stays a `kg_ground`
  decision); a term-overlap filter keeps only items the changed source actually
  mentions. Surfaced in `kg_context.advisory.reexaminable_verdicts` and a
  `## Re-examinable verdicts` GRAPH_REPORT section (new projector meta keys
  `reexaminable_verdicts` + `source_file_sigs`; no model schema change; R3 and
  the global `FAILURE_STATES` untouched). The divergence side mirrors it:
  `failed`-fated brief discards are surfaced as `reexaminable_discards` on a
  source change, with an **explicit** un-seal lever
  `kg_diverge_recall(project, reexamine=[candidate_ids])` (never auto-un-sealed).
  Pinned in `tests/test_reexaminable_verdicts.py` (9 tests) and
  `tests/fusion/test_materialization.py` (4 new tests).

### Fixed

- **Grounding no longer permanently buries novel `/kg-diverge` pins.**
  `_sync_materialized_fates` folded a materialized pin into its brief's
  **permanent** discards whenever its canon item reached the global
  `FAILURE_STATES` (`{rejected, failed}`) — so grounding a genuinely novel pin
  against the original source (which yields `rejected`: no in-source span, the
  *expected* state of novelty) discarded it **for being novel**. A new, narrower
  `server.MATERIALIZED_DISCARD_STATES = {failed}` now keys the fold: only an
  actively **falsified** pin discards; a merely **unsupported** pin stays
  recoverable in the lane until sources are added. Verdict neutrality is
  preserved (the change is in the diverge-brief-local *consequence*, not the
  verdict); the global `FAILURE_STATES` and the write-boundary durability
  quarantine backing `/kg-generate` negative memory are untouched. The
  `kg-grounder` prompt now leaves unsupported `[diverge]`-lineage edges
  `unverified` (triage), and `kg_diverge_materialize` returns an advisory-only
  note when a source is already configured. Pinned in
  `tests/fusion/test_materialization.py` (5 new tests, mutation-verified).

## 0.1.2 — 2026-07-04

Hardening release: the full 2026-07 review trilogy — maintainability
(review-r5), performance (review-r6), and correctness (review-r7) — plus a
documentation pass that makes the docs self-contained and drift-free against
the engine source. No user-facing API or tool-surface changes.

### Changed

- **2026-07 maintainability review (review-r5)**: ~45 findings applied — single
  homes for duplicated logic (`envconfig`, `dirlock`, `pathing`,
  `sources.split_sections`, failure-state vocabulary, `node_content_hash`, the
  derived-layer reader), decompositions of the largest functions (reconciler
  `scan`, divergence ingest, canon `write_nodes`, `run_generators`, bootstrap
  install), and clarity renames. Pinned in `tests/test_review_r5.py`
  (23 tests, including JS↔Python env-resolution parity).
- **2026-07 performance review (review-r6)**: lazy heavy imports (server import
  ~190 ms → ~60 ms), binary `.npz` divergence vector stores (legacy `.json`
  still read, migrated on next write), capped mechanism-spread computation,
  lazy-row farthest-point selection, stat-gated incremental canon parsing,
  glossary term cap + SQL LIMIT, and fsync skipped for session-ephemeral state.
  Pinned in `tests/test_review_r6.py`.

### Fixed

- **2026-07 correctness review (review-r7)**: 7 verified findings fixed and
  pinned in `tests/test_review_r7.py` (21 tests):
  - `model.py` frontmatter regex: the closing-fence `\s*` greedily ate the
    body's first-line indentation, making `node_from_markdown`∘`node_to_markdown`
    lossy (a 4-space code block lost its first line) and silently defeating
    canon's idempotent-no-op write guard (`node_content_hash` mismatch →
    spurious rewrite + timestamp-only commit). Now horizontal-whitespace-only.
  - `server.py` egress: `kg_write`, `kg_rename`, and `kg_merge` returned the
    canon rollback reason (`info.error`) unscrubbed, leaking an absolute vault
    path across the §1.9 boundary that every sibling error-return scrubs (the
    `_tool_result` envelope scrubs raised exceptions, not returned dicts). All
    three now route through `_scrub_error`.
  - `export.py`: chained `.replace()` rescanned the inlined data payload, so a
    node label equal to the `__KG_FAILURE_STATES_JSON__` sentinel corrupted the
    graph.html JSON. Now a single-pass `re.sub` that never rescans replacements.
  - `harness.py`: the `ideation`/`convergence`/`specificity` CLIs crashed with
    an uncaught `AttributeError`/`TypeError` on a malformed top-level JSON shape
    (array/scalar) instead of the clean exit-2 usage error `agreement` emits.
  - `generate.py`: `run_generators` was defined twice; the duplicate shadowed
    the first def and the review-r5 module-level helpers (`_convergence_tally`,
    `_dedup_candidates`, `_edge_key`), leaving them dead. The duplicate is
    removed so the module-level helpers are live and testable in isolation.
  - `agents/evaluator.md` / `commands/kg-experiment.md`: granted `kg_generate`,
    which the kg-evaluator is instructed to call for the graph+generate+dpp arm.
  - `commands/kg-ground.md` Stage 0b: the stale-verdict remedy prescribed
    `kg_ground(grounded, support_span=…)`, which is a no-op for a span-present
    edge (support_* only promote hypothesized items), so the flag never cleared;
    it now relocates the span via `kg_write` (a canon edit that re-opens
    grounding).
- Completed the I5 clock freeze in the test suite: canon's `utcnow` binding
  leaked wall time into the frozen-clock snapshot tests.

### Docs

- **`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`** — new self-contained architecture reference
  written from the engine source (module map, data model, boundary
  dispositions, verdict path, derived layer, divergence internals with the
  shipped constants, tool surface, env contract, provisioning/supervision,
  invariants). The documentation no longer relies on either donor's docs.
- `references/tools.md`: new §1B documenting the seven `kg_diverge_*` tools
  (parameters, return shapes, `.kg/diverge/` state layout, session
  ephemerality, engine constants) and §2.4 for the
  `python -m kg_engine.divergence` CLI incl. the selftest gates and importer
  report; `kg_generate`'s `dpp` parameter and `divergence_advisory` block
  documented; the harness section now covers all four subcommands
  (`convergence` was missing) and the full ideation arm list.
- `references/pack-schema.md`: the optional `divergence:` pack section is now
  part of the documented `PackContract` (shape-check vs deep-validation split
  per the I3 firewall); `pack/domains/_schema.md` stale pre-fusion paths
  (`config/domains/…`) corrected to `pack/domains/…`.
- `docs/MIGRATION.md` made self-contained: the selftest gates/margins, importer
  report shape, and every carried-over engine constant are stated in-file
  instead of deferring to "the donor's" values.
- SKILL.md: stale hand-written test count removed (the README's generated count
  is the single home), the `graph+generate+dpp` experiment arm added, and the
  references index now lists all six reference files.
- Donor-relative phrasings scrubbed from `commands/kg-generate.md`,
  `commands/kg-experiment.md`, and `references/contract.md`.
- `FUSION_PLAN.md` relocated from the repo root to `docs/fusion/`, joining the
  rest of the fusion decision record.
- **2026-07-04 doc drift-audit** (full doc↔source audit, adversarially
  verified): corrected six stale claims — the vendored Sproutgraph engine
  module count 20 → 21 (`docs/fusion/ATTRIBUTION.md`, `docs/fusion/INVENTORY.md`,
  and this changelog's 0.1.0 spine entry; the donor @`17c4066` has 21 top-level
  `.py` files, matching the sibling Cambrian "15 modules" convention);
  `references/contract.md`'s core-tool count "eleven" → "sixteen" (`server.py`
  exposes 16 core + 4 generative graph tools); `references/tools.md`'s
  `kg_generate` `divergence_advisory` block, now documented as the parallel
  `bins`/`semantic_novelty`/`cliche_distance` arrays plus
  `beyond_cap_kept_in_donor_order` that `advisory_geometry.py` returns (not a
  `candidates` list); and a missing `Bash` grant in `/kg-ground`'s frontmatter,
  whose Stage-0 note runs `python -m kg_engine.harness convergence`.

## 0.1.1 — 2026-07-03

Patch release: every finding from the 2026-07 full-codebase review (review-r4;
regression-tested in `tests/test_review_r4.py`), plus a stale-doc scrub and a
CLAUDE.md repo guide.

### Fixed

- **BOM tolerance**: a canon note hand-saved with a UTF-8 BOM (Windows
  Notepad's default) failed the frontmatter parse and silently vanished from
  every read — including its §1.7 failure memory. `node_from_markdown` now
  strips a leading U+FEFF at the single parse chokepoint.
- **Stale-edge leak on incremental reprojection**: the per-note edge diff was
  keyed on `source`, so a hand-edited note carrying an edge whose `source:`
  names another node leaked a stale `index.sqlite` row after the edge was
  removed (graph.json, rebuilt in full, disagreed). The edges table now
  carries an `owner` column (the persisting note); diff/delete key on it, a
  pre-`owner` DB reads as schema-outdated and heals via full rebuild, and
  `owner_of_edge` resolves the owning file rather than assuming
  `source == owner`.
- **§1.9 egress gaps**: the read-path re-scrub now covers `label`, kg_agenda
  `question` strings and kg_generate `rationale`s (ids stay untouched);
  kg_agenda and kg_generate route through `_scrub_egress` like the sibling
  reads; `kg_scrub` no longer counts identity (literal-placeholder) entries as
  redactions.
- A SIGKILLed PreToolUse hook could hold the canon lease past the writers'
  30 s budget on Windows (no pid probe there): the hook now declares a 15 s
  lease TTL and size-gates its synchronous reprojection (>400 notes serve the
  existing index instead of burning the 5 s cap on every read, forever).
- The divergence `ingest` now parses candidates and warm-loads the embedder
  BEFORE taking the project lock, so the first-use ~120 MB model download can
  no longer outlive the lock's 60 s staleness window and get it stolen
  mid-cycle.
- `backend.run()`'s post-run projection is guarded: a projection failure is
  recorded as `projection_error` in the summary instead of masking the run's
  own exception from the `finally`.
- `export._bridge_set` tie-breaks by id ASCENDING among equal
  `spec_betweenness`, matching kg_context's `ORDER BY … id ASC`.
- `advisory_geometry`'s `grounded_mix` counts incoming edges too
  (`G.edges(node)` is out-only on a MultiDiGraph).
- `build_engine_from_env` filters unsubstituted `${…}` values from
  `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_OPTION_*` reads, like every other env read.
- Divergence `_atomic_write` guards its temp-file cleanup so an unlink failure
  can't mask the real write error (parity with `atomicio`).

### Changed

- `run_generators` size-gates the exact convergence tally at
  `FULL_TALLY_MAX_NODES` (400): above it, mechanisms run at the surfaced `k`
  instead of materializing O(V²) candidates; the surfaced slate is identical.
- `kg_write` now reuses a cheap-signature-keyed canon baseline across calls
  (the server-side twin of backend-1), so a parallel `/kg-build` wave no
  longer re-parses the whole canon per write; any out-of-band write
  invalidates it.
- Depend on `igraph` directly (the `python-igraph` name is a deprecated PyPI
  alias for the same package).

### Docs

- Scrubbed the stale references to the donor's `ARCHITECTURE.md` (deliberately
  not vendored — see ATTRIBUTION.md) from SKILL.md, `references/contract.md`
  and two engine comments; the contract.md note on provenance demotion now
  states what `boundary.py` actually does (provenance is left exactly as
  declared). Added `CLAUDE.md` (repo guide for Claude Code).

### Tests

- New `tests/test_review_r4.py` regression file (12 tests) covering all of the
  above; the divergence-firewall pre-port guard now fails loudly instead of
  silently passing if the package stops resolving; a `sys.modules` stub leak,
  a duplicated helper, a byte-identical duplicate test, a module-level
  `sys.path` mutation and a vacuous sleep-based "writer blocks" assertion were
  cleaned up; `test_alpha_threshold_semantics` now actually tests the
  reliability threshold (and documents Krippendorff's rare-category zero).


## 0.1.0 — first release (2026-07-02)

Burgess 0.1.0 is the first release of the fused plugin: Sproutgraph's grounded
knowledge-graph convergence engine and Cambrian's diversity-preserving
divergence engine, one MCP trust boundary, one domain-pack format.

### The spine (vendored from Sproutgraph @ `17c4066`)

- Deterministic graph engine (`scripts/kg_engine/`, 21 modules): canon/derived
  split, span-present write boundary, `kg_ground` verdict monopoly, reconciler
  re-quarantine, span-staleness advisory, egress scrub, experiment harness.
- 8 slash commands, 6 subagents, SessionStart provisioning chain (uv + pip
  fallback), PreToolUse grounded-context injection, offline graph.html export.
- Full donor test suite green at exact baseline parity (731 passed, 2 skipped)
  before any fusion work landed.

### The divergence engine (vendored from Cambrian @ `a2adfa1`)

- `kg_engine/divergence/` (15 modules + importer): model2vec static embedder
  (`potion-multilingual-128M`; deterministic hash embedder for tests/offline),
  MAP-Elites archive with CVT open-axis niching, k-NN geometric novelty, greedy
  DPP slate selection with farthest-point fallback, anti-collapse monitor
  (entropy + mean pairwise cosine) with variety-erosion early warning, bounded
  judge influence (weight 0.3, fitness clip [0.7, 1.3] — donor constants,
  drift-guarded), advisory originality/gap probes, per-domain descriptor axes.
- All donor engine tests ported and green (226 tests).

### New in the fusion

- **`/kg-diverge`** — standalone divergence with no graph and no source
  required: cliché map (held-out split), mechanism-first generation, DPP slates
  with honest novelty semantics, pins/discards/A-vs-B, monitor reactions.
  Engine exposed as six `kg_diverge_*` MCP tools; project-local state under
  `.kg/diverge/` (explicitly not `~/.cambrian`); session-ephemeral geometry
  (a new session wipes the archive; pins/discards/comparisons survive).
- **Pin materialization** (`kg_diverge_materialize`) — the explicit door from
  divergence into the graph: pins become `provenance=hypothesized,
  epistemic_state=unverified` nodes via the propose lane exclusively, with full
  `[diverge]` lineage; promotion still requires support; verdict-neutral pin
  priority in the grounding queue.
- **Unified negative memory** — grounding failures of materialized pins flow
  back into the brief's discards automatically; neither `/kg-diverge` nor
  `/kg-generate` ever re-proposes from the failure store.
- **Advisory DPP over `/kg-generate`** — behind `divergence.dpp` (pack flag +
  per-call override): hybrid descriptors (semantic novelty + community /
  graph-distance / grounded-mix axes), grounded-hub cliché map, judge-bounded
  DPP ordering. Snapshot-enforced advisory: grounding output is bit-identical
  flag on vs off.
- **`graph+generate+dpp` experiment arm** + `dpp_verdict` in the harness; the
  shipped `divergence.dpp` default was decided by the pre-declared blind rule
  D1 (see `docs/fusion/EXPERIMENT.md`).
- **One domain-pack format** — `pack.yaml` carries the extraction vocabulary
  AND an optional `divergence:` section (behavior axes + flags); Cambrian's
  domain templates ship as pack fragments under `pack/domains/`.
- **State importer** — `python -m kg_engine.divergence import-cambrian` maps an
  old `~/.cambrian` project's pins/discards/comparisons into `.kg/diverge/`
  (read-only on the source).

### Invariants, enforced by tests before the features they guard

Verdict monopoly (I1), span-present boundary (I2), import firewall (I3), DB
isolation — no vector schema anywhere the query tools read (I4), advisory
ceiling with bit-identical grounding snapshots (I5), donor judge bounds (I6),
different-family embedder (I7), sticky + consulted negative memory (I8),
graceful degradation — every kg_* tool works with divergence deps blocked (I9),
session-ephemeral archives (I10), donors untouched (I11 — gate scripted and
green at every commit).
