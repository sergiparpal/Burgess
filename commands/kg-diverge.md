description: Turn any creative brief into a diverse, non-cliché slate of ideas — pure divergence, no graph and no source document required. Cliché map → mechanism-first generation → engine geometry (MAP-Elites, k-NN novelty, DPP slate, anti-collapse monitor) → the user pins/discards in chat. Pinned ideas can later be materialized into the hypothesized lane.

# /kg-diverge — standalone divergence (FUSION Stage 3)

Brief: $ARGUMENTS

You amplify creativity by pairing **your** generation + judgment with the plugin's local
**divergence engine**, which owns the anti-convergence math. Diversity is decoupled from
quality: geometry (the engine) decides what is *new*; you only filter what is *valid/on-brief*
and rank *within* a niche. Never let the judge pick the final slate. **The user is the real
selector.** Nothing here needs — or touches — the knowledge graph: no sources, no canon, no
verdicts (ideas can enter the graph later, only through the propose lane, and only if the
user materializes their pins).

The engine runs inside the plugin's MCP server as the `kg_diverge_*` tools. There is no
interpreter to locate and no hand-off files to write — the tools take JSON directly. If a
`kg_diverge_*` tool errors with a provisioning message (engine deps still installing), relay
it verbatim and wait; convergence tools are unaffected by design (I9).

## One session

1. **Project + session.** Choose a short `PROJECT` slug for this brief (e.g. `"cold-brew-launch"`)
   and ONE session id for this chat session (e.g. `"sess-<date>-<short-random>"`). State lives
   project-locally under `.kg/diverge/<project>/`. Session rule (I10): the geometry archive is
   ephemeral — passing a NEW session id wipes it; re-passing the SAME id within this chat resumes
   it. Pins and discards always survive across sessions.

2. **Resolve axes** (diversity is only meaningful relative to descriptor axes). Cascade:
   - the user named a domain that ships as a template (`pack/domains/*.yaml` or
     `pack/domains/examples/*.yaml` — e.g. `generic`, `marketing`, `product_features`,
     `research_hypotheses`): pass its name as `axes`;
   - else **infer** 4–6 descriptor axes from the brief per `references/axis_inference.md`
     (exactly one `open` axis marked `primary_novelty: true` — the mechanism carrier) and
     **confirm them with ONE short question** the user can accept or tweak; pass the result
     as an inline `axes` dict;
   - else omit `axes` — the engine prefers the pack's `divergence:` section, falling back to
     the neutral generic template.

   Then call `kg_diverge_init(project, axes, session)` and `kg_diverge_recall(project)` —
   recall returns prior pins/discards/comparisons for this brief so you generate AWAY from
   what the user already discarded and FROM what they pinned.

3. **Map the clichés (anti-cliché directive), before generating.** Enumerate the **~6 most
   obvious/cliché answers** to *this* brief. Split: **O_train** (first ~3 — keep in view,
   deliberately generate *away* from them) and **O_test** (last ~3 — set aside; never look at
   them while generating, never optimize toward them). After a slate is presented you *may*
   report each idea's distance to the held-out **O_test** as advisory originality — never
   validate against O_train (Goodhart trap), and never let any originality number pick or rank
   the slate. Caveat honestly: "obvious" is your notion of cliché; this hedges cliché, it does
   not guarantee novelty against the world.

4. **Generate candidates yourself, mechanism-first**, using `references/operators.md`
   (apply several DIFFERENT operators per round):
   - *Layer 1 — mechanism first.* Before writing a candidate's `text`, choose its
     **mechanism** (the open-axis value): the core "how it works" in a few words, far from
     (a) O_train's mechanisms, (b) mechanisms already used this round or in the archive.
     **Same mechanism = same idea.**
   - *Layer 2 — surface second.* Write the `text` that expresses that mechanism.
   - **Descriptor discipline:** niche placement runs on YOUR descriptor words. No two
     candidates share a `mechanism` string unless they genuinely share a mechanism; prefer
     the extremes of continuous axes over the middle; make each axis value meaningfully
     distinct. See `operators.md` → "Descriptor discipline".

5. **Prefilter** with `references/judge_rubric.md`: drop ONLY invalid/off-brief candidates.
   NEVER judge novelty here. You may attach a within-niche `fitness` (0–1) — the engine clips
   its influence to a bounded multiplier ([0.7, 1.3] at weight 0.3); you may NOT use it to cut
   variety. If you find yourself dropping more than ~40% of a round, you are over-filtering.

6. **Ingest.** Call `kg_diverge_ingest(project, candidates, axes, seed)` with the survivors:

   ```json
   [{"id": "c1", "text": "the idea, one or two sentences",
     "descriptor": {"angle": "…", "scope": "…", "form": "…", "boldness": 0.9,
                     "mechanism": "the core how, a few words"},
     "fitness": 0.8,
     "genealogy": {"operator_id": "analogy", "parents": []}}]
   ```

   Give every candidate a fresh unique `id` (`c<round><letter>` works). Use the same `axes`
   argument you initialized with, and one integer `seed` per session for reproducibility.

7. **Present the returned `slate`** — for each idea: its text, mechanism label, niche
   `coords`, and a one-line *why-picked* (which niche it holds + what its `novelty` says).
   Field honesty: `novelty` is mean k-NN distance to THIS SESSION's own ideas — a variety
   proxy, not originality vs the world; `mechanism_novelty` is the same for its mechanism.
   Report them as such. Then:
   - ask only the returned `ask_pairs` as short A-vs-B questions;
   - **explicitly invite pinning any idea** — "pin any of these to keep exploring from? any
     of them, not just A/B" (pins are the strongest, durable signal: always parents, recalled
     across sessions, and later materializable into the graph via /kg-generate's propose lane);
   - **offer the discard lever** — "drop any of these so we stop building on them?" (a discard
     is durable negative memory: never re-slated, never bred from; re-pinning un-discards).
     Discarding is the user's call, never yours.

8. **Record & continue.** For each answer/pin/discard call `kg_diverge_remember(project,
   event)` with `{"type":"pin","id":…}` / `{"type":"discard","id":…}` /
   `{"type":"comparison","winner":…,"loser":…}`. Then `kg_diverge_parents(project)` for
   diverse stepping stones (pins always kept, discards always excluded) and loop from step 4,
   or stop on the user's word.

9. **React to the monitor** (the `mon` block in every ingest result — advisory notice to the
   user, never a question):
   - `collapsing: true` → say so briefly, then REGENERATE under diversity pressure
     automatically: new operators, forbid the crowded niches, demand distance from recent
     ideas. Never remove or bypass the monitor.
   - `under_generation: true` → you over-prefiltered; next round generate the full target and
     cut only invalid ideas, never the merely unusual.
   - `variety_eroding: true` (early warning: survivor novelty decaying faster while submits
     stay healthy) → push unused operators and *mechanism* variety next round.

10. **Session-end gap summary** (only when the axes set `engine: {gap_probe: true}` and ingest
    results carried a `surface_mechanism_gap` block): fetch `kg_diverge_metrics(project)` and
    give a short plain-language read of its `gap_log` across the whole session — varied in
    *approach* or only in *wording*? Measurement only; it never steers selection.

## Notes

- **Selftest** (engine correctness contract, offline): `python -m kg_engine.divergence selftest`
  from the plugin's engine venv — variety gate, DPP-beats-first-N, null check, collapse
  reversal. Also runs in the test suite (`tests/fusion/divergence/test_selftest_e2e.py`).
- **Importing old Cambrian state:** `python -m kg_engine.divergence import-cambrian
  --project <slug> [--from ~/.cambrian/<old-project>]` maps a Cambrian project's pins/
  discards/comparisons into `.kg/diverge/<slug>/` (best-effort, read-only on the source).
- **Materializing pins (explicit, kickoff Q5).** When the user asks to carry pinned ideas
  into the knowledge graph, call `kg_diverge_materialize(project[, candidate_ids])` — each
  pin becomes a node in the HYPOTHESIZED lane (`provenance=hypothesized`,
  `epistemic_state=unverified`, full `[diverge]` lineage in the body), routed exclusively
  through the propose door. Nothing enters the graph implicitly: only on the user's word,
  only pins, only during a session that still holds the idea's record (I10 — a stale pin is
  reported `skipped`; re-ingest it first). No source in the project? The ideas simply WAIT
  in the lane. Optional `edges` link materialized ideas to existing nodes (same boundary:
  forged verdicts stripped, text claims refused). Materialized pins may be ground FIRST by
  /kg-ground (priority is ordering only — verdict-neutral by test). Grounding a materialized
  pin against an existing source will (correctly) leave it `unverified` — a novel idea has no
  in-source span yet — so it WAITS in the lane, recoverable, until you add supporting sources;
  a merely-unsupported (`rejected`) pin is **never** auto-discarded. Only when a pin is actively
  FALSIFIED (`failed`) does the next `kg_diverge_init`/`recall` fold it into this brief's
  **permanent** discards (unified negative memory, I8) and tell you. When a source is already
  configured, `kg_diverge_materialize` returns an `advisory` note that says exactly this.
- **Re-examinable discards (non-monotonic evidence).** The brief's negative memory is permanent
  on purpose — but evidence changes. When the **source set changes** after a pin was falsified,
  `kg_diverge_init`/`kg_diverge_recall` surface those `failed`-fated candidates under a
  `reexaminable_discards` list (`{candidate, fate:"failed", reason:"source-set-changed-since-judged"}`)
  — the divergence mirror of /kg-ground's re-examinable advisory. This is **surface-only**: it does
  NOT auto-un-seal anything. If the user decides a discarded idea deserves a second chance against the
  new source, call `kg_diverge_recall(project, reexamine=[candidate_ids])` — the **explicit** un-seal
  lever: it drops those candidates from the discards and clears their failure fate so they return to the
  proposal pool to be re-materialized / re-grounded. It never changes a graph verdict.
- Everything the engine computes is **advisory ordering** — embeddings measure dispersion,
  never truth (FUSION invariant I5).
