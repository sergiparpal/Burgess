"""Single home for the engine's environment/config resolution rules — a stdlib-only LEAF module.

Imported by the engine (``server.py``), the installer (``bootstrap.py``), the PreToolUse hook
(``hooks/precontext.py``), and the optional lightrag arm — several of which run OUTSIDE the engine
venv, before any third-party dep exists, so this module must depend on NOTHING beyond the standard
library (the same constraint as ``atomicio``; ``kg_engine.__init__`` is import-light, so importing
this never pulls in the heavy engine). The JS twin of ``clean`` lives in
``scripts/_engine_resolve.mjs`` — the one declared cross-language mirror.

Until review-r5 these rules lived in five hand-synced copies with two different sentinel sets, and
the ``${...}`` placeholder filter (review-r4: opt-skips-placeholder-filter) had landed in only one
of them: the hook's ``metrics_mode`` read an unsubstituted ``${user_config.metrics_mode}`` as a real
value. Every consumer now resolves through here; the hook's two documented adaptations
(``plugin_data_fallback``, ``plugin_root``) are explicit keyword knobs at its call sites instead of
a forked copy of the rule.
