"""Cross-platform, self-provisioning bootstrap for the Burgess engine venv.

This is the single source of truth for building the engine's virtualenv. It is
invoked three ways, all idempotent and safe to re-run:

* by the plugin's ``SessionStart`` hook (``hooks/provision.mjs`` — the single
  cross-platform launcher since review-r5; ``provision.sh``/``provision.ps1`` remain
  as dev shims that exec it) right after the plugin is installed/loaded — see
  ``--background`` below;
* by the MCP launcher (``scripts/launch_server.mjs``) as a foreground last-resort if
  the server is spawned before the background provision has finished (graceful catch-up);
* by a developer from a shell (``python scripts/bootstrap.py``).

What it does — adapted to this repo's runtime model:

* creates a venv and installs the engine's **dependencies** (``uv sync
  --no-install-project`` when ``uv`` is on PATH, else stdlib ``venv`` + ``pip``).
  Unlike the sibling ``creativity-amplifier`` plugin, ``kg_engine`` itself is *not*
  imported from the venv's site-packages — it resolves via ``PYTHONPATH=<repo>/scripts``
  (see ``.mcp.json``), so only the dependencies in ``pyproject.toml`` must land here.
* records the resolved venv interpreter path in ``<venv>/engine-python.txt`` so the
  launchers find it on any OS without hard-coding ``bin/python`` vs ``Scripts\\python.exe``.
* with ``--reconcile`` (set by the detached SessionStart worker), runs the canon
  reconcile (§1.8) after the venv is ready — the once-per-session full re-hash that
  re-quarantines mtime-spoofed forged verdicts. Best-effort, never fatal.

Where the venv lives (first match wins):

1. ``--venv PATH``                  (explicit; passed by the MCP launcher)
2. ``$KG_ENGINE_VENV``              (explicit override)
3. ``$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA/.venv``    (installed via marketplace — persists across plugin
                                     updates; the recommended location)
4. ``<repo>/.venv``                 (developer fallback: ``--plugin-dir .`` / shell — the
                                     same venv ``uv sync`` from the repo root builds)

Idempotency & robustness:

* A content stamp (hash of ``pyproject.toml`` — the dependency source of truth — plus the
  backing interpreter's minor version + platform + arch) lets a fast path skip work when the
  venv is current, and forces a rebuild when a plugin update changes dependencies OR a
  same-path interpreter swap would leave its compiled wheels ABI-mismatched. (Engine
  *source* edits need no rebuild: ``kg_engine`` is read live off ``PYTHONPATH``, never
  installed.)
* An atomic lock dir serializes concurrent provisions (the SessionStart worker, extra
  terminals, the launcher racing the hook) so two builds never clobber a venv.
* ``--background`` re-spawns a fully detached worker and returns in milliseconds, so
  even a Claude Code without ``async`` hook support never blocks on the install.
